### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a beginner in C++
I am decent at Java

Minecraft is my favorite game!

I have a YouTube channel where I play Minecraft (It's bad lol but please subscribe)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on school work so my goals are irrelevant at the moment
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ (also with C but not as much as C++) and Java \[Also trying to learn OpenGL for at least C++ and C\]
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing yet
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with pretty much any repo I have lol
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: make an issue on this page because I don't like to share personal stuff
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love cats (especially calico cats) and my favorite game is Minecraft
